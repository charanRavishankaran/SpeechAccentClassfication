# SpeechAccentClassfication
An AI that classifies whether the english speaker is a Russian or an Indian based on their voice. Built using speech processing methods and machine learning models. The records were collected among people from Russia and India who speak English
as a second language. Participants are all in age from 21 to 26 and both genders are not equally presented. Machine learning methods like support vector machines, random forest, and Convolution Neural Network classifiers are used to improve the
accent classification accuracy.
